# vuePlaner
Demo of a class schedule app for college students.
See it working at [my website](http://dorianm.com/demos/vue-planer/).

## Background and purpose
First, my goal was to try Vue 3 and test out Vuex which I've never used before. I wanted to try a full on Vuex approach, where the state controls every reactive interaction. I now see this method as rather confusing and substandard, but nevertheless fun. 
Second, Polish universities commonly use a system in which a student looks up classes via a customizabe list. Then, when she is done with registering to her prefered/obligatory classes, she can preview her schedule. My goal was to whip up a demo of a more interactive system.

## How it's made
App made with Vue 3 with Vue CLI, no external plugins or libraries. SVGs made with Inkscape.

## Anything else?
I like the finished app, so in the future I will probably clean it up, split the components a bit more and fork a less vuex-y version.
External class database (connects via PHP API) uses texts from Wikipedia.
